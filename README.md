Upon running the program it will ask you to enter an initial balance. It will then create an account and will ask the amount that you would like to deposit in which you can enter a negative number and an exception will be caught. The same goes for withdrawing an amount larger than your balance. Another exception will be caught if you try to deposit or withdraw from a closed account. The downsides to this program is that there is no error handling for negative withdraw amounts or negative initial deposits, however you can implement this by creating more exception classes to handle those cases. At the end of the program there is an option to test withdrawing from a closed account exception in which you remove the comments and it should produce a invalid account operation exception.
